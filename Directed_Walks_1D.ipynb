    "# Problem 5 (Directed Walks)\n",
    "Start with two different kinds of particles. Think of the particles as predator and a prey. Predators sense and chase prey. In practice, that means that a certain percent of the time, 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, which is fixed and given at the beginning of the simulation, predators will move towards prey and the rest of the time (1 − q), they will just move randomly. Start in one dimension with one predator and one prey and for now let the prey move completely randomly. Vary initial condition and report the time it takes for the predator to reach the prey. This exercise is far more interesting in two and three dimensions; do both, and pick how many directions of movement you want to use.\n",
